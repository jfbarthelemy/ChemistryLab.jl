# Calculation of thermodynamic properties of calcite dissolution

This example is equivalent to quickstart except that no database is needed.

Let us recall the example which consisted of studying the dissolution of calcite in water.

$\ce{CaCO3 <=> Ca^2+ + CO3^2-}$


It is possible to calculate the thermodynamic properties of the reaction, in particular the solubility constant of the reaction ($\ln K$) which is related to the Gibbs free energy of the reaction ($\Delta_r G^°$). This solubility constant is a function of temperature and the calculation is performed at a reference temperature of 298 K and at a pressure of 1 Atm using the following equation:

$\Delta_r G^° = - RT\ln K$

where $\Delta_r G^°$ is deduced from the Gibbs energies of formation ($\Delta_f {G_i}^°$) of the other chemical species involved in the reaction:

$\Delta_r G^° = \sum_i \nu_i \Delta_f {G_i}^°$

### First step: species declaration

The first step, therefore, is to construct each of the species present in the reaction. This can be done with the [`Species`](@ref) function. Its simplest use is as follows:

```julia
using ChemistryLab

calcite = Species("CaCO3", aggregate_state=AS_CRYSTAL, class=SC_COMPONENT)
Ca²⁺ = Species("Ca+2", aggregate_state=AS_AQUEOUS, class=SC_COMPONENT)
CO₃²⁻ = Species("CO3-2", aggregate_state=AS_AQUEOUS, class=SC_COMPONENT)
```

The created object contains a certain amount of information wheose properties can be entered *a posteriori* (or during the construction of the [`Species`](@ref)).

```@example example1
using ChemistryLab #hide

calcite = Species("CaCO3", aggregate_state=AS_CRYSTAL, class=SC_COMPONENT) #hide
Ca²⁺ = Species("Ca+2", aggregate_state=AS_AQUEOUS, class=SC_COMPONENT) #hide
CO₃²⁻ = Species("CO3-2", aggregate_state=AS_AQUEOUS, class=SC_COMPONENT) #hide
CO₃²⁻
```

!!! note "Calculation of Molar Mass"
    It can be noted that during the construction of the species, a calculation of the molar mass is systematically performed.

### Second step: calculation of the thermodynamic properties of each species

For each species, it is possible to assign thermodynamic properties, such as the Gibbs energy of formation or the heat capacity. This data can be found in databases (e.g. [thermoddem database](https://thermoddem.brgm.fr)). For calcite, the properties are described in the following figure (which is a capture of the Thermoddem website).
![Figure](../assets/calcite_properties_thermoddem.png)

#### Thermodynamic properties of formation

The first step involves associating the values ​​of the thermodynamic properties of formation for each species. For calcite, this can be done as follows:

```julia
th_prop_0_calcite = Dict(:Cp⁰ => 83.47u"J/K/mol", :ΔₐH⁰ => -1207605u"J/mol", :S⁰ => 91.78u"J/K/mol", :ΔₐG⁰ => -1129109u"J/mol", :V⁰ => 36.934)
```

#### Heat capacity, enthalpy and free energy as a function of temperature

The second step is to describe the evolution of heat capacity as a function of temperature for each species. As exposed in the previous figure, heat capacity is expressed as a function of temperature: $C_p = a + bT + cT^2$. A reference temperature can then be defined in order to construct thermodynamic functions, such as heat capacity, entropy, enthalpy and free enthalpy. For calcite, this can be done as follows:

```julia
using DynamicQuantities
params_Cp_calcite = Dict(:a₀ => 99.72u"J/K/mol", :a₁ => 26.92e-3u"J/mol/K^2", :a₂ => -21.58e5u"J*K/mol")
T_ref = Dict(:T => 298.15u"K")
params_calcite = merge(th_prop_0_calcite, params_Cp_calcite, T_ref)
dtf_calcite = build_thermo_functions(:cp_ft_equation, params_calcite)
```

!!! tip "Expression of Cp as a function of temperature"
    In the Thermoddem database, the expression for heat capacity as a function of temperature is written as:

    $C_p(T) = a + b * T + c * T^{-2}$

    However, the expression given in Thermoddem for this species is a simplification of the following more complete function:
    
    $a_0 + a_1 * T + a_2 * T^{-2} + a_3 * T^{-0.5} + a_4 * T^2 + a_5 * T^3 + a_6 * T^4 + a_7 * T^{-3} + a_8 * T^{-1} + a_9 * T^{0.5} + a_{10} * log(T)$

    This expression is implemented in ChemistryLab and can be called by passing `:cp_ft_equation` as an argument.

Calling the `thermo_functions` (here `build_thermo_functions`) allows the calculation of the expressions for the different thermodynamic properties as a function of temperature, according to the following expressions:

$\Delta_a {H^°}_T = \int_{T_{ref}}^T C_p(\tau) d\tau + \Delta_f {H^°}$

${S^°}_T = \int_{T_{ref}}^T \frac{C_p(\tau)}{\tau} d\tau + {S^°}$

$\Delta_a {G^°}_T = \int_{T_{ref}}^T C_p(\tau) d\tau - T * \int_{T_{ref}}^T \frac{C_p(\tau)}{\tau} d\tau - (T - T_{ref}){S^°}_{T_{ref}} + \Delta_f G^°$

where $\Delta_a {H^°}_T$ and $\Delta_a {G^°}_T$ are the apparent enthalpy and free energy (Gibbs) at T.

The expressions for the thermodynamic properties of calcite can be added to the species `calcite` as follows:

```julia
calcite.Cp⁰ = dtf_calcite[:Cp⁰]
calcite.ΔₐH⁰ = dtf_calcite[:ΔₐH⁰]
calcite.S⁰ = dtf_calcite[:S⁰]
calcite.ΔₐG⁰ = dtf_calcite[:ΔₐG⁰]
```

The symbolic expression is computed for each property and writes as follows for Gibbs energy of calcite:

```@example example1

using ChemistryLab #hide
using DynamicQuantities #hide

th_prop_0_calcite = Dict(:Cp⁰ => 83.47u"J/K/mol", :ΔₐH⁰ => -1207605u"J/mol", :S⁰ => 91.78u"J/K/mol", :ΔₐG⁰ => -1129109u"J/mol", :V⁰ => 36.934) #hide
params_Cp_calcite = Dict(:a₀ => 99.72u"J/K/mol", :a₁ => 26.92e-3u"J/mol/K^2", :a₂ => -21.58e5u"J*K/mol") #hide
T_ref = Dict(:T => 298.15u"K")
params = merge(th_prop_0_calcite, params_Cp_calcite, T_ref)
dtf_calcite = build_thermo_functions(:cp_ft_equation, params)
calcite.Cp⁰ = dtf_calcite[:Cp⁰]  #hide
calcite.ΔₐH⁰ = dtf_calcite[:ΔₐH⁰] #hide
calcite.S⁰ = dtf_calcite[:S⁰] #hide
calcite.ΔₐG⁰ = dtf_calcite[:ΔₐG⁰]
```

```@example example1
using Plots

p1 = plot(xlabel="Temperature [°C]", ylabel="ΔₐG⁰ [J.mol⁻¹]", title="Gibbs energy of calcite \nas a function of temperature")
plot!(p1, θ -> calcite.ΔₐG⁰(T = 273.15+θ), 0:0.1:100, label="ΔₐG⁰ of calcite")
```


Similarly, we can provide information on the thermal capacity of species $\ce{Ca^2+}$ and $\ce{CO3^2-}$, as proposed in the thermoddem database:

![Figure](../assets/ca_properties_thermoddem.png)

![Figure](../assets/co3_properties_thermoddem.png)


These new properties are also functions of temperature. However, unlike calcite, the heat capacities of $\ce{Ca^2+}$ and $\ce{CO3^2-}$ as a function of temperature are expressed using the Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers (HKF) equation for Cp(T) of aqueous ions. The HKF Cp(T) model is not currently available as a built-in thermodynamic model in ChemistryLab; we therefore use the constant value at 25 °C given in Thermoddem, that is -26.38 and -276.88 J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹ respectively.


```@example example1
th_prop_0_Ca²⁺ = Dict(:Cp⁰ => -26.38u"J/K/mol", :ΔₐH⁰ => -543000u"J/mol", :S⁰ => -56.2u"J/K/mol", :ΔₐG⁰ => -552806u"J/mol", :V⁰ => -18.154) #hide
params_Cp_Ca²⁺ = Dict(:a₀ => -26.38u"J/K/mol") #hide
params_Ca²⁺ = merge(th_prop_0_Ca²⁺, params_Cp_Ca²⁺, T_ref)
dtf_Ca²⁺ = build_thermo_functions(:cp_ft_equation, params_Ca²⁺)
Ca²⁺.ΔₐG⁰ = dtf_Ca²⁺[:ΔₐG⁰]

th_prop_0_CO₃²⁻ = Dict(:Cp⁰ => -276.88u"J/K/mol", :ΔₐH⁰ => -675230u"J/mol", :S⁰ => -50.00u"J/K/mol", :ΔₐG⁰ => -527900u"J/mol", :V⁰ => -5.275) #hide
params_Cp_CO₃²⁻ = Dict(:a₀ => -276.88u"J/K/mol")
params_CO₃²⁻ = merge(th_prop_0_CO₃²⁻, params_Cp_CO₃²⁻, T_ref)
dtf_CO₃²⁻ = build_thermo_functions(:cp_ft_equation, params_CO₃²⁻)
CO₃²⁻.ΔₐG⁰ = dtf_CO₃²⁻[:ΔₐG⁰]
```

!!! warning "HKF Cp(T) model for aqueous ions"
    The Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers equation for the temperature dependence of Cp of aqueous ions is not yet available as a built-in thermodynamic model. The expressions for enthalpies and free energies remain temperature-dependent thanks to the integration performed on Cp. Within the temperature and pressure ranges typically considered in ChemistryLab (0–100 °C, 1 atm), assuming a constant Cp has little impact on the solubility product.

### Third step: writing the reaction

Now we can write the dissolution/precipitation reaction of calcite.

```@example example1
r = Reaction([calcite, Ca²⁺, CO₃²⁻]; equal_sign='↔')
```

During the construction of this reaction, the thermodynamic properties of the reaction are calculated.

$RT \; ln(K) = - \Delta_r G^° = - \sum_i \nu_i  \Delta_f {G^°}_i$

```@example example1
using Plots

p1 = plot(xlabel="Temperature [K]", ylabel="pKs", title="Solubility product (pKs) of calcite \nas a function of temperature")
plot!(p1, θ -> r.ΔᵣG⁰(T = 273.15+θ) / 8.31 / (273.15+θ) / log(10), 0:0.1:100, label="pKs")
```

## Notes and next steps

This example demonstrates the **manual** workflow: create species, attach thermodynamic data from an external source, build a reaction and evaluate its temperature-dependent properties.

In practice, loading species from a built-in database (see [Database Interoperability](@ref sec-databases)) is faster and less error-prone:

```julia
all_species = build_species(datapath("cemdata18-merged.json"))
species = speciation(all_species, split("Cal H2O@");
              aggregate_state=[AS_AQUEOUS], exclude_species=split("H2@ O2@ CH4@"))
```

To go further and compute the actual **equilibrium state** (species amounts, pH, saturation index), build a `ChemicalSystem` from the species and call `equilibrate`. See the [Chemical Equilibrium](@ref sec-equilibrium) tutorial for the complete workflow.
