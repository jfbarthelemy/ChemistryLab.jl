## v0.4.0 — Equilibrium actually coupled to kinetics, and dual numbers everywhere

### Breaking

- **`ChemicalState` gained a fourth type parameter**, `R <: Real`, carrying the
  number type of the dimensionless diagnostics: the signature is now
  `ChemicalState{C, S, Q, R}`. Code that spelled the type out in full has to be
  updated; code that used `ChemicalState` without parameters is unaffected.
- `pH`, `pOH`, `porosity` and `saturation` no longer return `Float64`
  unconditionally. They return whatever number type the composition carries, so
  that `∂pH/∂composition` and `∂porosity/∂(w/c)` are obtainable.

### Fixed — the equilibrium was never actually solved during a kinetics run

Four independent defects, each sufficient on its own to disable re-speciation.
They combined to make the whole coupling dead code, and the errors were hidden.

- **`equilibrate(state, ::EquilibriumSolver)` throws.** That is the call
  `build_kinetics_ode` made. `equilibrate` expects a SciML *algorithm* and wraps
  it into an `EquilibriumSolver`; handing it one that is already built wraps it
  twice, and the solve has no applicable method. The entry point for a prebuilt
  solver is `solve(esolver, state)`, which is what is called now.
- **The failure was swallowed by a bare `catch`**, so a run in which
  re-speciation never once succeeded looked exactly like a healthy one.
  Failures are now counted, the first is reported with its exception, and the
  total is reported at the end of `integrate`.
- **`KineticsSolver(; equilibrium_solver = …)` was never read.** `integrate`
  built its parameters from the `KineticsProblem` alone, so the documented way
  of passing a solver did nothing. It is honored now; a solver set on the
  problem still wins, and the conflict is reported.
- **The integrated element amounts `bₑ` were discarded.** The ODE integrates
  `dbₑ/dt = Aₑ νₑᵀ r`, but the re-speciation rebuilt its input from the
  persistent buffer instead, so the constraint of the equilibrium sub-problem
  (Leal et al. 2017, Eq. 54) was not the quantity being integrated. The previous
  speciation is now projected onto `bₑ` through `pinv(Aₑ)` before the solve.

### Fixed — three defects that made the `kinetic_species` API produce nonsense

Found while implementing the partitioned coupling, all on the 3-argument
`KineticsProblem(cs, state, tspan)` path:

- **The controlling mineral was mis-identified.** `_find_mineral_idx` takes the
  first crystalline reactant and, failing that, the first reactant of any kind.
  On a reaction generated from the nullspace — where the kinetic mineral may sit
  on either side — that is the solvent, so the ODE integrated **water** as the
  dissolving phase. A species the system declares kinetic now wins over any
  guess.
- **The stoichiometry had an arbitrary orientation**, so the kinetic mineral
  could carry `ν = +1` and the ODE grew the clinker: α(C₃S) came out at −4.2
  over seven days. Reactions are now normalized to `ν = −1` on their controlling
  mineral, which also delivers the `1/|νₖ|` scaling the `ChemicalSystem`
  docstring already promised.
- **The conservation basis was inconsistent.** `Aₑ` was cut from the canonical
  element matrix `CSM.A` while the solve is posed on `SM.A`, the matrix with
  respect to the primaries; and the equilibrium sub-system re-derived its own
  primaries instead of inheriting the parent's. Either mismatch makes every
  equilibrium solve fail — 89 failures out of 89 steps in one intermediate
  state. `Aₑ` now comes from the sub-system itself, which shares the parent's
  primaries.

With the three fixed, seven days of C₃S/C₂S hydration at `w/c = 0.4` gives
α(C₃S) = 0.277, portlandite and C-S-H in comparable amounts, an alkaline pore
solution at millimolar calcium, and `‖Aₑnₑ − bₑ‖∞ = 8.7e-8`.

### Changed — the coupling is now the partitioned formulation of Leal et al.

`respeciate!` solves `nₑ = φ(bₑ)` over the **equilibrium partition only**, on a
sub-system built for the purpose, with the integrated element amounts `bₑ`
handed to the solver as the constraint rather than derived from a composition.
Running the minimization over the whole system, as the previous code did, would
equilibrate the kinetic minerals instantaneously.

### Changed — operator splitting instead of a solve inside the right-hand side

The equilibrium sub-problem is no longer solved inside the ODE right-hand side.
It is solved once per accepted step, by the new `respeciate!`, wired as a
`DiscreteCallback`. The right-hand side is evaluated many times per step and
differentiated to build the Jacobian; solving an optimization problem in there
made the cost unpredictable and the Jacobian inconsistent with the model being
integrated. With the solve outside, residual and Jacobian see the same
speciation.

### Fixed — the conservation matrix was rebuilt by finite differences

`OptimaSolverExt` did not pass `A` and `b` through the problem parameters, so
`OptimaSolver` fell back to reconstructing the constraint Jacobian by finite
differences with a `1e-7` step. The element balance was capped at ~2e-6 mol and
did **not** respond to the requested tolerance. `A` is known exactly; it is
handed over now. Measured on calcite/water: feasibility `2.17e-06 → 4.02e-14`.

This also settles the choice of default back-end. Once the matrix is exact,
OptimaSolver reaches machine-level feasibility *and* is 3 to 26 times faster
than Ipopt on the cement equilibria, so it remains the high-priority default.

### New — differentiating *through* the equilibrium solve

`ForwardDiff` now crosses an `equilibrate`. No solver is asked to iterate on
dual numbers — Ipopt is a C library and never could. The equilibrium is solved
once at the primal values and the sensitivities come from the optimality
conditions of [Leal2017](@cite), the problem Reaktoro solves: one saddle-point
factorization serves every partial derivative, and the answer is exact rather
than a finite difference.

The complementarity block is what partitions the species, and skipping it does
not degrade the answer gently. On calcite + CO₂ in water with a gas phase
declared, the unreduced system puts the whole response into the **absent** gas
species (`n = 5e-11` mol) — a sensitivity that satisfies the element balance to
`4e-16` and means nothing. No back-end returns the stability multipliers `z`, so
the active set is recovered internally: a species negligible on the scale of the
system that nonetheless takes a leading share of the response is pinned and the
system re-solved.

Verified against the package's own finite differences (`9e-5`, the truncation
error) and against **Reaktoro 2.13** (~6 %, the two using different
thermodynamic databases). The absent gas species gets exactly zero from the
active-set treatment, against `2e-9` by finite differences.

### Fixed — dual numbers could not enter a `ChemicalState`

The constructor took its element type from the *temperature*
(`Q = typeof(T_q)`), which silently cast the composition to `Float64`: nothing
downstream of a `ChemicalState` was differentiable. The type is now the
promotion of `T`, `P` **and the amounts**. The dimensionless diagnostics follow
(see Breaking above); only their *display* strips the dual part.
